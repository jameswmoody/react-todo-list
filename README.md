# To Do List

This web app is a simple to do list that takes advantage of some of the many benefits provided by React.js such as modular components and more efficient performance. Since each DOM element is only updated if there have been changes made, there is no need for an entire list to be re-rendered when a new item is added. Instead, only the list item itself will be updated.

### Getting Started

It's very simple to get this app up and running. Just open up your local command line and run `npm start`. If you do not have Node.js installed, you can [get it here.](https://nodejs.org/)

After that, just open your favorite web browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in all of it's modular glory.

Feel free to make changes to my code on your local machine. The page in your browser will automatically reload if you make edits.
